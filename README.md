## History

- Interconnect is being created by @bevry with the help of contributors like yourself
- It's being lead by @balupton who's been toying with Interconnect since 2013
- The idea originally started as a open-source sqwiggle clone but has now evolved into its own product
- @crito was the first person to develop a working prototype of Interconnect, showing that it is possible.
- It is now developed on the `rtc.io-polymer` branch, making heavy use of web components
- @ninabreznik provided valuable feedback indicating the social applications of Interconnect (such as browsing people's profiles)
- During January and February @myplanetdigital sponsored the development of the project and provided additional resources
  - Such as Jacques Ramphal who did the amazing v1 and v2 design mockups
  - And Peter Last who provided the competive analysis for ambient telepresence solutions
- We are now looking for further funding and more people to help implement the vision
